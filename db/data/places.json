Curiously, the land of Labrynna is most notable for its deep connection to the flows of time  and is best known for being the home of the guardian of the flows of time, the Oracle of Ages, and the Oracle's protector, the Maku Tree.

Hyrule's original population of Minish founded this Village, which continues to thrive today, although many Minish have relocated outside of the Minish Woods since then. All Minish, since their expansion, categorize themselves based on location: those still living within the confines of the Minish Village call themselves Forest Picori, as do the many living in the outskirts and about the Minish Woods. The Forest Picori are supervised by their elder, Gentari. The architecture of the Minish Village ranges from hollowed out Barrels, habitable shoes, and mushrooms – anything in the area big enough to support the sedentary, minimalist Minish lifestyle. The Minish Village's existence is a secret to all but those with close ties to the Royal Family of Hyrule. ",

In contrast to Dungeons, which are isolated and explored from a beginning to an end point, the Overworld is much larger with more open-ended exploration. Since Ocarina of Time, it has been common for the Overworld of a title to include a type of hub most Overworld areas connect to, such as Hyrule Field. As mentioned, there are multiple Overworld settings to be explored with many ways to traverse their varying topography. ",
