[{"games":[],"name":"Era of Hylia","description":"The Triforce was entrusted to the goddess Hylia during the Era of Hylia, known more fully as the Era of the Goddess Hylia. One day, the Demon King Demise sought to take it and make the world his own. He rose an army of malevolent forces against Hyrule. Hylia gathered the surviving humans on an outcrop of earth and sent it to The Sky beyond a Cloud Barrier of her creation. The outcrop would later become known as Skyloft. She hid the Triforce there as well. Hylia rallied the remaining land dwellers, fought back the evil forces led by Demise, and sealed them away. She suffered grave injuries in the battle. Knowing the seal on Demise would not hold, she devised a plan. As the Triforce could not be wielded by a god, Hylia renounced divinity and transferred her soul to the body of a mortal who would come of age when Demise returned. She created the Goddess Sword and the spirit Fi to aid her chosen hero, who would reveal himself when he drew the sword from its pedestal.","id":"5f6d14563d599c9df7c3fdf4"},{"games":["5f6ce9d805615a85623ec2c8"],"name":"Sky Era","description":"During the Sky Era, Hylia is reborn as Zelda in Skyloft.
