When Ganon arrives at North Castle's courtyard, he fires the spell at Princess Zelda, but she deflects with the Triforce of Wisdom's magic, which causes the spell to bounce around and eventually captures Link instead. Ganon decides that capturing Link is satisfactory and leaves back to the Underworld. Although the Wand of Power was able to send Link's body to the Evil Jar, it did not capture his spirit since the spell was weakened as it was bouncing around. This leaves Link to wander around the castle and the underworld as a ghost while Zelda works to recover his body.
